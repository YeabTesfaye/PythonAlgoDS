the difference between Generator and python list 

Generator:
  - Lazy Evaluatio :- compute and generate values as requested
  - Memory Efficiency:- They generate values on-the-fly, consuming minimal memory regardless of the size of the sequence


List: 
  - Eager Evaluation: Lists are eagerly evaluated. When the list is created, all values are computed and stored in memory. This can be memory-intensive, especially for large datasets or infinite sequences.
