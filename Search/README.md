# Search Algorithms

This repository contains a `Search` class that provides implementations of various search algorithms. The class includes the following methods:

| Method Name                | Description                                                     | Time Complexity    | Space Complexity   |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `binary_search`            | Perform binary search on the array iteratively.                 | O(log n)            | O(1)              |
| `binary_search_recursive`  | Perform binary search on the array recursively.                 | O(log n)            | O(log n)          |
| `linear_search`            | Perform linear search on the array.                             | O(n)                | O(1)              |
